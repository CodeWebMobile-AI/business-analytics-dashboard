## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

*   **Database:** (Configure in Laravel `.env` - typically MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js:** (Latest LTS version recommended)
*   **npm** or **yarn:** (npm is included with Node.js)
*   **PHP:** (Version 8.0 or higher recommended)
*   **Composer:** (PHP dependency manager)
*   **Database Server:** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
*   **Git:** (For version control)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/business-analytics-dashboard.git
    cd business-analytics-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Install Laravel dependencies (backend):**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Configure the database:**

    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

    *   Edit `.env` and configure your database connection settings (DB\_CONNECTION, DB\_HOST, DB\_PORT, DB\_DATABASE, DB\_USERNAME, DB\_PASSWORD).

4.  **Generate application key:**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

6.  **Install frontend dependencies (React):**

    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

## Development Setup

1.  **Start the Laravel development server (backend):**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    php artisan serve
    ```

    (This will usually start the server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`)

2.  **Start the React development server (frontend):**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```

    (This will usually start the server at `http://localhost:3000`)

    **Note:** You may need to configure the frontend to point to the correct backend URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default). This will likely be in a file like `src/config.ts` or similar.

## Usage Examples

After successful installation and setup, you can access the dashboard in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

*   **Viewing Sales Data:** Navigate to the "Sales" section to view sales performance metrics, including total revenue, sales trends, and top-selling products.
*   **Analyzing Customer Behavior:** Explore customer analytics dashboards to understand customer demographics, purchase patterns, and engagement levels.
*   **Monitoring Marketing Campaigns:** Track the performance of marketing campaigns by analyzing metrics such as click-through rates, conversion rates, and return on investment.
*   **Customizing Dashboards:** Add, remove, and rearrange widgets on the dashboard to create a personalized view of key metrics.

## API Documentation Structure

The backend API uses RESTful conventions.  Here's a general overview of endpoints.  (Replace with specific API endpoints when available):

*   `/api/sales` - Returns sales data. Supports filtering by date range. (e.g., `/api/sales?start_date=2023-01-01&end_date=2023-01-31`)
*   `/api/customers` - Returns customer data. Supports pagination and filtering by segment.
*   `/api/products` - Returns product data, including sales performance and inventory levels.

**Data Format:**

All API endpoints return data in JSON format.

**Authentication:**

The API is protected by authentication.  You will need to obtain an API token (typically through a login process) and include it in the `Authorization` header of your requests. Example: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN`

* `/api/login` - Login endpoint. Expects `email` and `password` in the request body. Returns an API token upon successful authentication.
